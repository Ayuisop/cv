<p>I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms
  and networks,
   the roles they play in large-scale social and information systems,
   and their broader societal implications. My work has been supported by an
   NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur
    Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons
     Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar
     Bush Faculty Fellowship, and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo,
     the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of
      the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of
       Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>

 <h2>Books and Teaching</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>In Spring 2022, Karen Levy and I are teaching Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed
     at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.
<ul>

<li>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed
  at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with
   optional advanced sections.</li></ul></li>
   <li>D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. Networks, Crowds, and Markets:
      Reasoning About a Highly Connected World. Cambridge University
       Press, 2010.<ul><li>This book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we both teach. We also use the more advanced parts
          for our graduate algorithms course.</li></ul></li>
   <li>J. Kleinberg, E. Tardos. Algorithm Design. Addison Wesley,
      2005<ul>
       <li>This book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we both teach. We also use the more advanced parts for our
         graduate algorithms course.</li></ul></li>
   <li>An on-line course on edX entitled Networks, Crowds, and Markets,
      with David Easley and Eva Tardos.</li>
   <li>Recent courses at Cornell:<ul>
     <li>The Structure of Information
      Networks (CS 6850).</li>
 <li>Networks (with David Easley and Eva Tardos; ECON 2040 / SOC 2090 /
